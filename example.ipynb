Introduction    [physics.ins-de    The silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) has evolved into an  established photodetector technology. They are used in  CN high-energy physics [J] [2] 3], astroparticle physics [4] [5],   medical imaging [6] [7], and LIDARs [8] [9], to only name   a few areas of application. One key factor to the success   of SiPMs is the continuing effort made by manufacturers   ©} to reduce nuisance parameters like dark-count rate, after-  © pulsing, and optical crosstalk.   00 Diagnostic tools are crucial in these efforts as they help   © to identify means that further reduce nuisance parameters,   CO which in turn, improves the performance of SiPMs. One   ‘— way to diagnose SiPMs is to measure their characteristics   > as function of temperature and bias, model the data, and   Ne extract physical meaningful quantities from the model pa-   w rameters. We have taken that approach in earlier work  cS [£0] and we use it again here.   In this paper we emphasize the use of the bias depen-  dence of the breakdown probability, which we already used  in to determine the origin of optical crosstalk in a  Hamamatsu device and extend it to a discussion of the lo-  cation of the avalanche region. The approach is not new,    *Corresponding author  Email address: otte@gatech.edu (Adam Nepomuk Otte)    Preprint submitted to Elsevier    we first presented it at [I/] and it was used to characterize  FBK devices [12]. Compared to [12] we use a parameter-  ization, which is less dependent on the device specifics as  we will discuss in detail.    2. Devices used in this Study    The Hamamatsu SiPM is a prototype named LVR2-  6050-CN. The device has an active area of 6 x 6mm? and  is composed of 50 wm sized cells. For better UV sensitiv-  ity the sensor is not covered with a protective layer. The  breakdown voltage at room temperature (24°C) is 38.4V  and the bias voltage to achieve a 90% breakdown probabil-  ity for 400 nm photons is about 42 V (see later). That bias  voltage is less than the 56 V required for the Hamamatsu  LCT5 device we tested in [10]. Whether the lower bias is  due to a narrower high-field region in the present device  or due to other changes in the technology we do not know.   The second device is a KETEK PM3325 WB SiPMEJIt  has an active area of 3x 3mm? and 25 pm cells. The chip is  protected with a 400 wm thick glass window. The PM3325  does not feature trenches to suppress optical crosstalk.    https: //www.ketek.net/store/category/  sipm-standard-devices/wb-series/    December 18, 2018\n"
